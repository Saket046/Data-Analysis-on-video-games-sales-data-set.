# Data-Analysis-on-video-games-sales-data-set.
first exploratory data analysis on a video games sales data set, on which I asked some basic questions and find answers through pandas, matplotlib and numpy. I also tried  pandas-profiling which is a great tool for beginners in data science. I have also done data preprocessing which is important step for model building then I created a dashboard on tableau which makes it easier to draw insights from the dataset.
